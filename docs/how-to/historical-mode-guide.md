## Introduction

Historical Mode transforms the Ancient Atlas Generator from a fantasy map creator into a historically-inspired ancient world generator. It uses authentic civilizations, naming patterns, political systems, and geographic features from the Bronze Age (3300-1200 BCE) and Classical Age (800 BCE - 500 CE).

### What Historical Mode Offers

- **10 Historical Civilizations**: Egyptian, Sumerian, Minoan, Hittite, Mycenaean, Greek, Roman, Persian, Carthaginian, and Celtic
- **Authentic Naming**: City names, leader names, and dynasties based on historical patterns
- **Period-Appropriate Features**: Pyramids, ziggurats, temples, fortifications, and trade routes
- **Political Systems**: City-states, empires, republics, and tribal confederations
- **Historical Military Units**: Chariots, hoplites, legionnaires, war elephants, and more
- **Religious Systems**: Historical pantheons with deities and sacred sites

## Getting Started

### Enabling Historical Mode

1. Click the **►** arrow button on the left side of the screen to open the options panel
2. Navigate to the **Options** tab
3. Find the **Map Mode** dropdown (near the top)
4. Select **Historical** from the dropdown
5. Two new options will appear:
   - **Preset**: Quick-start configurations
   - **Time Period**: Bronze Age or Classical Age
   - **Civilizations**: Select which civilizations to include

### Generating Your First Historical Map

The easiest way to start is with a preset:

1. Enable Historical Mode (see above)
2. Select a preset from the **Preset** dropdown (e.g., "Ancient Egypt")
3. Click the **New Map** button (or press F2)
4. Wait for the map to generate (typically 1-2 seconds)

Your historical map is ready! The map will feature:
- Historically-named cities and states
- Period-appropriate political boundaries
- Ancient landmarks (pyramids, temples, etc.)
- Historical military units and fortifications

## Tips and Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Preset

1. **For Beginners**: Start with single-civilization presets (Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece)
2. **For Complexity**: Use mixed presets (Bronze Age World, Classical Age World)
3. **For Scenarios**: Try conflict presets (Mediterranean Conflict, Greco-Persian Wars)

### Customizing After Generation

1. **Edit State Names**: Click on state labels, use historical names
2. **Adjust Borders**: Use the politics tools to modify territories
3. **Add Custom Landmarks**: Use the markers tool to place additional sites
4. **Modify Cultures**: Use the culture editor for fine-tuning

### Creating Realistic Maps

1. **Match Geography to Civilization**:
   - Egyptian → River Valley template
   - Greek → Peninsula template
   - Minoan → Archipelago template
   - Roman → Mediterranean template

2. **Appropriate State Numbers**:
   - City-states: 15-25 small states
   - Regional powers: 8-15 medium states
   - Empires: 2-5 large states

3. **Historical Accuracy**:
   - Bronze Age: Smaller states, less infrastructure
   - Classical Age: Larger empires, more roads and cities

### Performance Tips

1. **Start Small**: Generate smaller maps first (default 960x540)
2. **Limit Civilizations**: 2-3 civilizations for faster generation
3. **Reduce Towns**: Lower manor count for quicker generation

## Troubleshooting

### Preset Not Applying Correctly

**Problem**: Settings don't change when selecting a preset

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure Historical Mode is enabled first
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Manually verify settings after applying preset

### Map Doesn't Look Historical

**Problem**: Generated map looks like fantasy, not historical

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Historical Mode is enabled (Map Mode = Historical)
2. Check that "Antique" culture set is selected
3. Apply a historical visual style (historical-bronze or historical-classical)
4. Generate a new map after changing settings

### Civilizations Not Showing

**Problem**: Civilization dropdown is empty or wrong civilizations appear

**Solutions**:
1. Select the correct Time Period first
2. Civilizations filter by period (Bronze Age vs Classical Age)
3. Refresh the page if options don't update

### Names Not Historical

**Problem**: Cities and leaders have fantasy names instead of historical names

**Solutions**:
1. Verify "Antique" culture set is selected
2. Ensure civilizations are properly selected
3. Check that Historical Mode is enabled before generation
4. Try regenerating the map

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Map generation is slow or browser freezes

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce canvas size (960x540 is recommended)
2. Lower points number (10K is recommended)
3. Reduce number of states and towns
4. Use fewer civilizations (1-3 instead of 5)
5. Close other browser tabs

### Missing Features

**Problem**: Landmarks or historical features don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Generate a new map (features are placement-dependent)
2. Check that enough suitable terrain exists (e.g., desert for pyramids)
3. Some features are rare and may not appear every time
4. Manually add missing features using the markers tool
