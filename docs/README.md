# Ancient Atlas Generator Documentation

This documentation follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), organizing content into four distinct categories based on user needs.

## Documentation Structure

### 📚 [Tutorials](./tutorials/)
**Learning-oriented** - Step-by-step lessons for newcomers

Tutorials are lessons that guide you through a series of steps to complete a project or learn a concept. They're designed for learning, not for achieving a specific goal.

- Getting started guides
- First map generation tutorials
- Learning the basics of the generator

### 🔧 [How-To Guides](./how-to/)
**Task-oriented** - Practical guides to achieve specific goals

How-to guides provide directions for accomplishing specific tasks. They assume you understand the basics and want to achieve a particular outcome.

- Generating specific types of maps
- Customizing civilizations
- Exporting and sharing maps
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 📖 [Reference](./reference/)
**Information-oriented** - Technical descriptions and specifications

Reference material provides detailed technical information about the system. It describes the machinery and how it works.

- **[Conversion](./reference/conversion/)** - Implementation plans for transforming Fantasy Map Generator into Ancient Atlas Generator
  - [Implementation Roadmap](./reference/conversion/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) - Quick reference guide with session-by-session steps
  - [Ancient Atlas Analysis](./reference/conversion/ANCIENT_ATLAS_ANALYSIS.md) - Comprehensive technical analysis and detailed implementation guide
- API documentation (when available)
- Data model specifications
- Configuration file formats
- Module reference

### 💡 [Explanation](./explanation/)
**Understanding-oriented** - Background, context, and deeper understanding

Explanations clarify and illuminate topics. They provide context, discuss alternatives, and explore the "why" behind decisions.

- [Project Overview](./explanation/project-overview.md) - High-level summary of the Ancient Atlas Generator project
- Architecture decisions
- Historical accuracy considerations
- Design principles
- Technology choices

## Quick Navigation

### For New Users

## About the Diataxis Framework

The Diataxis framework helps organize documentation to serve different user needs:

```
                 Learning  |  Tasks
                ------------|----------
    Study        Tutorials  |  How-to
                ------------|----------
    Work         Reference  |  Explanation
```

This structure ensures:
- **Findability** - Users can quickly locate the information they need
- **Clarity** - Each document type has a clear purpose
- **Completeness** - All user needs are addressed
- **Maintainability** - Contributors know where to add new content

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding documentation:

1. **Tutorials** - Add learning-focused content that guides through a complete process
2. **How-To Guides** - Add task-focused guides that solve specific problems
3. **Reference** - Add technical specifications, API docs, or implementation plans
4. **Explanation** - Add conceptual content that explains "why" and provides context
