## What are Explanations?

Explanations are **understanding-oriented** content that clarifies and illuminates topics. They provide context, discuss alternatives, and explore the "why" behind decisions.

### Characteristics of good explanations:
- ✅ Provide context and background
- ✅ Explore alternatives and trade-offs
- ✅ Discuss the "why" not just the "how"
- ✅ Connect to broader concepts
- ✅ Deepen understanding

### What explanations are NOT:
- ❌ Not tutorials (those are for learning by doing)
- ❌ Not how-to guides (those solve problems)
- ❌ Not reference material (that's technical description)

## Using Explanations

Read explanations when you want to:
- Understand design decisions
- Learn about trade-offs
- Get context for features
- Understand the "big picture"
- Make informed decisions about contributions
