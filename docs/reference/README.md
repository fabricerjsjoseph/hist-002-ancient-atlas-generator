## What is Reference Documentation?

Reference documentation is **information-oriented** material that provides detailed technical information about how the system works.

### Characteristics of good reference:
- ✅ Structured by code/function/module
- ✅ Consistent in format
- ✅ Factual and accurate
- ✅ Up-to-date with the codebase
- ✅ Serves as lookup material

### What reference documentation is NOT:
- ❌ Not tutorials (those are for learning)
- ❌ Not how-to guides (those solve problems)
- ❌ Not explanations (those provide understanding)

## Using Reference Documentation

Reference documentation is meant to be **consulted** when you need to:
- Look up technical details
- Understand implementation specifics
- Find the exact syntax or parameters
- Verify current behavior
- Plan implementation work

For **developers working on the conversion**, the [conversion folder](./conversion/) contains all the technical specifications and implementation plans you'll need.
